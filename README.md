Scala Code Snippets
===================

Just a collection of Scala code snippets that I have accumulated over various projects and assignments.  I'm using this repo as a way to keep track of them. Hopefully some of them can be helpful to others as well.


| Package Name  |  Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| NewtonsMethodSquareRoot  | Recursive implementation of the Newton method for finding square roots.  |
| TailRecursiveFactorial | Implementation of factorial function using tail recusion to keep stack space constant.  |
| ListSumMax  |  Two recusive functions that find the max and sum of a list, repectively. |
| AnySum | Tail Recursive function that sums the input function over the input interval |
| AnyProductFactorial | General product function, also the factorial function written in terms of it |
| SumOrProduct | Very general function that applies a function over the specified interval and combines the subsequent values in a way defined by the combine function |
| FindFixedPoints| Recursively find fixed points of an input function with an initial guess |
| Rationals | A class that implements the properties of rational numbers |
| IntegerSets | Binary tree implementation of Sets of integers |
| CounterActor | Asynchronous communication between two Akka actors maintaining a count state. |
| BankAccount | Implements asynchronous bank account with Akka actors.  Supports withdrawals, deposits, and wire transfers between two accounts.
| LinkChecker | Implements an asynchronous link checker for a specified URL using Akka actors. |
